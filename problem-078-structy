Write a function, nonAdjacentSum, that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. The function should return the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array. 
There is no limit on how many elements can be taken into the sum as long as they are not adjacent.


iterative solution:
const nonAdjacentSum = (nums) => {
  // todo
  //can think of it like a binary tree
  
  let outside = nums[0]
  let inside = 0
  let skip = 0
    for(let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
    {
       skip = outside > inside ? outside:inside
       outside = inside + nums[i]
       inside = skip
      
    }
  return outside > inside ? outside:inside

};
